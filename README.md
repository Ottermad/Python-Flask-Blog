Python Flask Blog
=================

This is a basic blog. I have built it myself using the following technologies:

* [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/)
* [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Peewee ORM](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee)
* [MySQL database](http://www.mysql.com/)
* [Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Features include:

* Basic User Authentication - it allows a single admin user to add, edit and delete posts.
* Bootstrap Frontend - it uses the bootstrap framework to create a visually appealling and responsive frontend.
* CRUD operations - using the Peewee ORM it performs all the CRUD operations on a MySQL database.
* Markdown Compatibilty - I used the markdown libary to format posts.
